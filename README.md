# Recommender-System:
In this project i have tried to create a recommender system that will tell us if we have watched a certain movie which all movie we could watch.
# Introduction:
In this project i have tried to implement a Recommender System on Movie Lens Data that suggests which movie we should watch if 
we have watched a certain movie.This i have implemented using Pearson correlation.
# Objective:

# Motivation:
