# Recommender-System:
In this project i have tried to create a recommender system that will tell us if we have watched a certain movie which all movie we could watch.
# Introduction:
In this project i have tried to implement a Recommender System on Movie Lens Data that suggests which movie we should watch if 
we have watched a certain movie.This i have implemented using Pearson correlation.
# Objective:
To make a recommedation to which movie one should watch if he has watched a certain movie.
# Motivation:
Recommender systems help the users to get personalized recommendations, helps users to take correct decisions in their online transactions, increase sales and redefine the users web browsing experience, retain the customers, enhance their shopping experience. Information overload problem is solved by search engines, but they do not provide personalization of data. Recommendation engines provide personalization.

# Workflow:    
  Exploratory Data Anaylsis:    
   1.Average rating given to a movie.    
   2.No of viewers giving rating to particular movie.    
   3.Visualisation of the average rating.    
   4.Visualisation of number of users per movie.    
   5.Coverting into a pivot with ratings as values.    
   6.Finding of a movie with all other movie.    
   7.Filtering out movie based on certain no of user that have given rating.    
# Result:
Successfully Build a recommender system that will predict if someone has watched certain movie she may also watch the other movies.From my recommender System i could deduce that if someone has watched Star Wars movie she may like
